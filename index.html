								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ProfilePicPano.jpg" alt="Emily in South Korea" /></span>
								<p>Hi there! My name's Emily and I was born in Ballarat, Victoria (Australia), where I grew up with my mum, dad, younger sister and brother. I completed Year 12 VCE at Sebastopol Secondary College in 2003. Since high school I have completed a Bachelor of Arts (Psychology) at Deakin University and a Certificate IV in Live Production & Technical Services at Box Hill TAFE.</p>

							</p>My employment history is diverse, as I have worked in a variety of roles across various sectors including theatre, not-for-profit organisations and cinema. I am currently employed as Deputy Company Manager on Disney’s The Lion King International Tour, which has taken me touring around Asia for the last two years. Though we are currently ‘grounded’, I look forward to getting back on the road soon.</p>

								<p><b>FUN FACTS:</b> I love musical theatre and the arts, travelling, yoga, meditation and getting outside into nature, espeically when it's sunny! <br> También estoy aprendiendo español (I am also learning Spanish) </p>

									<p>To gain a deeper insight into my personality, check out the results from three online self-assessments I completed below:</p>
									<hr>
									<h3>Myers-Briggs Style Personality Test</h3>
									<p>The <a href = "https://www.16personalities.com" = target="_blank">16 Personalities Test</a> is an online questionnaire that attempts to measure differing preferences in how people percieve the world and make decisions. Results are based on four categories, plus an identity type. The combination of these results determines assignment to one of sixteen possible personality types. The scales measured are:
									<ul>
										<li>Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I) - How a person gets their energy</li>
										<li>Intuitive (N) vs Observant (S) - What a person does with the information gathered from the world around them</li>
										<li>Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F) - How a person makes decisions</li>
										<li>Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P) - How a person organizes their world.</li>
										<li>Assertive (A) vs Turbulent (T) - This identity scale affects all others and indicates how confident we are in our abilities and decisions</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p><b>My Personality Type is </b><a href = "https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality" = target="_blank"><b>Defender - ISFJ-T</b></a>
									<br><i>The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.</i></p>
										<p><b>I - Introvert 70%</b>
										<br>Introverts are energized by spending quiet time alone or with a small group. They tend to be more reserved and thoughtful.
										<br>
										<br><b>S - Observant 70%</b>
										<br>Those with the Observant style are interested in observable facts and straightforward outcomes. They prefer to avoid layering too much interpretation on what they see.
										<br>
										<br><b>F - Feeling 78%</b>
										<br>Feelers tend to make decisions with their hearts; they are interested in how a decision will affect people, and whether it fits in with their values.
										<br>
										<br><b>J - Judging 58%</b>
										<br>Judgers appreciate structure and order; they like things planned, and dislike last-minute changes.
										<br>
										<br><b>T - Turbulent 69%</b>
										<br>Turbulent individuals are success-driven, perfectionistic, and eager to improve. They are always trying to counterbalance their self-doubts by achieving more.</p>

										<hr>

									<h3>Learning Style</h3>
										<p>The <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/" = target="_blank">Learning Style Test</a> asseses a person's preferred learning style; the way they will learn best. There are three possible learning style results:
											<br>Auditory, Visual & Tactile/Kinesthetic.</p>
										<p><b>My Learning Style is Visual</b>
											<br>This means I will learn best when information is presented in a written language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams.
										</p>

										<hr>

									<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
										<p>The <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test" = target="_blank">Big Five Personality Test</a> measures the five personality factors that psychologists have determined are core to our personality makeup:
											<ol>
											<li>Openness - How open a person is to new ideas and experiences</li>
											<li>Conscientiousness - How goal-directed, persistent, and organized a person is</li>
											<li>Extraversion - How much a person is energized by the outside world</li>
											<li>Agreeableness - How much a person puts others' interests and needs ahead of their own</li>
											<li>Neuroticism - How sensitive a person is to stress and negative emotional triggers</li>
										</ol>
											</p>
										<p><b>My Scores on the Big Five Personality Test are:</b>
										<br>Openness: 65%
										<br>Conscientiousness: 81%
										<br>Extraversion: 27%
										<br>Agreeableness: 79%
										<br>Neuroticism: 67%

									<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
									<p>I feel the results of these online tests are accurate for me, so they are helpful in understanding the way I experience the world and interact with others. As a student, it’s helpful to know that I am a visual learner as there are steps I can take to improve my study, including taking notes during classes, watching videos on relevant topics, and reviewing information by re-writing it from memory. The Myers-Briggs and Big Five Personality tests provide a range of insights into my personality, including that I am introverted, enjoy supporting others, am conscientious, open and dedicated. They also show weaknesses such as repressing feelings, perfectionism and tending to blame myself when something goes wrong. The information provided by these tests is useful because it helps me be aware of my feelings, actions and behaviours so that I may cope better in a variety of situations.<p>

									<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
									<p>The results of my tests show there are both strengths and weaknesses for me when working in a team. As a Defender personality type, I am organised, reliable, and have good people skills, despite being mostly introverted. I am also good at listening to and supporting others which are great skills for teamwork. However, the test suggests that Defender’s strong sense of duty and innate altruism, mean it is often easy to become overloaded by others, for example, by taking on too much work. The results suggest that Defender’s need to know when to say no and stand up for themselves in order to maintain confidence and enthusiasm, and this ability could be important when completing work in a team.<p/>

									<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
									<p>In forming a team, it would be ideal for me to work with others who have some similar traits as me, such as being reliable, organised and hard-working. If I happened to be in a team where some members didn’t do their fair share of the work or were happy to leave things until the last minute, that would be very frustrating for me and I would find it tricky to deal with. The contradiction in my personality type of being introverted but also having good people skills and being open, means I can communicate well and get along with most other personality types. Therefore, my main considerations are to work with others who are going to contribute equally, be organised and reliable.</p>

								<h2 class="major">IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ITImage_Edit2_1280W_97KB_Pano.jpg" alt="Computer screens with coding" /></span>
								<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h3>
								<p>It is only in the last year or so that my interest in IT has been sparked, as I realised through my current job and co-workers how useful various IT programs / solutions can be. I became interested in ways that IT impacts the workplace, and how it can be used to improve efficiency, productivity, processes and overall business success. As I began to delve further into IT, I also became interested in understanding the fundamentals of IT including programming and databases. It fascinates me that everything we see on our screens basically comes down to code, as I have never given this concept much thought. The world of IT is very far from my usual interests and skills, but as we increasingly embrace technology in every aspect of our daily lives, I am keen to gain a better understanding and explore how IT innovations can improve our lives.</p>

								<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
								<p>I chose to study at RMIT as it has a great reputation and the course seemed like it would give me a good mix of theory and practical skills. RMIT is also known for having good links to real world industries, which I believe will be beneficial if I would like to pursue a career in IT. I found RMIT’s course as part of the Federal Government Subsidised Short Courses during COVID, and felt it was a good match for me, with the ability to study online and complete a course within 6 months while I am currently not able to work.</p>

								<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
								<p>I am undertaking the Undergraduate Certificate in Information Technology (6 month course), and during my studies I expect to gain a basic overview of the vast world of IT, as well as practical skills in a few specific areas. Upon course completion, I expect that I will have the knowledge and skills to feel confident creating basic websites independently. I also expect to learn some coding languages, in order to create basic programs. I will gain insights into user-centred design, how databases function, as well as some practical skills that can be used in these fields. Overall, I expect that I will learn a lot about various IT programs and languages that I previously knew nothing about including Java, HTML, CSS, various code editors, GitHub and SQLite.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/CreativeWordPressDesigners.jpg" alt="Creative WordPress Designer Job Ad" /></span>
								<p>My ideal job in IT would be working in web design and development. This job ad on Seek for a
